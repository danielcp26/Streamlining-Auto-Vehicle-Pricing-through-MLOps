# Streamlining-Auto-Vehicle-Pricing-through-MLOps

Recomendations:

- Implement a more robust data cleaning and quality assurance process so the pipeline will always treat outliers, missing values or any other inconsistency when new data comes into the project.

- Try other regression models that might perform better like xgboost regressor or Neural Networks if we want to improve the accuracy of the model.
